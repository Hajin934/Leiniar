# About Me
My personal repository.

I am a Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology student.
I like studying a bit (not really 🤗) but still studious.
I like do sports like badminton, I'm bad at basketball.
Also, I play online games. I believe that's where I'm good at. 😎

Currently learning how to use GitHub for my future projects.
Have a lesson this semester about Web Developement.
Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Not fully, still learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
I haven't yet touched JavaScript but after our midterms will do.

Already planning my portfolio, that's why I'm also learning GitHub, Git.

FUN FACT: 🧐

I'm studious but I'm also lazy. 😌

Thank you!. 💞
